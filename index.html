      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have studied IT but have always been interested in learning to code. I was around 16 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS back when Mozilla started a code initiative "Mozilla Thimble" on teaching every generation how to code. While I was studying in the university I took Information Technology but it wasn't really hands on the practical bit which is one of the reasons to why i joined <a href="http://moringaschool.com/"> <em>Moringa School </em></a>, which so far has been so good and now i have in depth knowledge in HTML,CSS and Github just to name a few. That and my previous interest in learning code created a spark to turn my hobby into more than passion and one day to a career.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the few projects i've worked on before

        <em>Hello-world</em> 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In this page you will see my first attempt in making a website,which was a success! It was developed with HTML and basic Css styles.
