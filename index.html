      <h3>More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have studied IT but have always been interested in learning to code. I was around 14 years old when I made my first web page with HTML and CSS back when Mozilla started a code initiative on teaching every generation how to code. While I was studying in the university I took Information Technology but it wasn't really hands on the practical bit which is one of the reasons to why i joined <a href="http://moringaschool.com/"> <em>Moringa School </em></a>, which so far has been so good and now i have in depth knowledge in HTML,CSS and Github just to name a few. That and my previous interest in learning code created a spark to turn my hobby into a career.
